    * S10/data/set1 to set 6/a1.txt to a10.txt

* A total of 150 documents to preprocess and use as pool for our short answer extraction model. 

* For each main folder a question_answer_pairs.txt was provided to score or model. 
* We will be pulling the questions ONLY from those files to generate a questionary dataset.
